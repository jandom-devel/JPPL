        JPPL are Java bindings for the <a href="https://www.bugseng.com/parma-polyhedra-library">PPL</a> (Parma
        Plyhedra Library) written using the <a href="https://github.com/java-native-access/jna">JNA</a> (Java Native
        Acccess)
        library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the PPL already comes with Java bindings (in the following called
        <em>standard binding</em>), we think they have many shortcomings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>They are not available in online Java repositories and scarcely available
            in OS package repositories (for example, in the Linux world, the Java
            bindings are packaged by Fedora but not by Debian or Ubuntu).
        <li>There is no common interface explicitly implemented by numerical domains.
            This make generic programming imposible without recurring to reflexivity.
        <li>Conventions do not follow the Java standard practices (for example, words
            in multi-word class names are separated by an underscore).
        <li>Some parts of the API (such as the one for linear expressions) ar quite
            cumbersome to use.
    </ul>
    <p>
        JPPL strives to overcome these shortcomings. The fact that the standard
        bindings are not readily available online in binary form led us to write a
        complete replacement for them, instead of a simple wrapper. JPPL uses JNA to
        interface directly with the C bindings of the PPL. Obviously, this choice
        also has its shortcomings, mainly:
    <ul>
        <li>JPPL is probably slower than the standard bindings.</li>
        <li>JPPL only works (at least at the moment) with the default configuration
            of the C bindings of the PPL.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The central corenerstones of JPPL are the two interfaces
        {@link it.unich.jppl.Domain Domain} and {@link it.unich.jppl.Property Property}.
        Every class which implements a numerical domain should implement the Property
        interface. Methods of the Property interface are operations which may be
        performed on geometric objects, such as projection over a dimension, convex
        hull, refinement with a linear expressions, etc... F-Bounded polymorphism is
        used for correctly typing the parameters and return value of these methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Domain is a factory for geometric objects. Each class implementing Property
        has a companion class implementing Domain (for example, Polyhedron implements
        Property while PolyhedronDomain implements Domain). Domain has a single method
        called {@code createProperty} in several overloaded variants which
        returns a property of the corresponding class.
