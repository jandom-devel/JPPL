        JPPL are Java bindings for the <a href="https://www.bugseng.com/parma-polyhedra-library">PPL</a> (Parma
        Plyhedra Library) written using the <a href="https://github.com/java-native-access/jna">JNA</a> (Java Native
        Acccess)
        library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the PPL already comes with Java bindings (in the following called
        <em>standard bindings</em>), we think they have some shortcomings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>They are not available in standard online repositories and scarcely available
            in OS package repositories (for example, in the Linux world, the Java
            bindings are packaged by Fedora but not by Debian or Ubuntu).
        <li>There is no common interface explicitly implemented by abstract domains.
            This make generic programming impossible without recurring to reflexivity.
        <li>Conventions do not follow the Java standard practices (for example, words
            in multi-word class names are separated by an underscore).
        <li>Some parts of the API (such as the one for linear expressions) are quite
            cumbersome to use.
    </ul>
    <p>
        JPPL strives to overcome these shortcomings. The fact that the standard
        bindings are not readily available online in binary form led us to write a
        complete replacement for them, instead of a wrapper. JPPL uses JNA to
        interface directly with the C bindings of the PPL. Obviously, this choice
        also has its shortcomings, mainly:
    <ul>
        <li>JPPL is probably slower than the standard bindings.</li>
        <li>JPPL only works (at least at the moment) with the default configuration
            of the C bindings of the PPL.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The central cornerstones of the JPPL are the two interfaces
        {@link it.unich.jppl.Domain} and {@link it.unich.jppl.Property}. Every
        nunerical abstract domain should implement both.
        {@link it.unich.jppl.Property} is the interface for the elements of an
        abstract domain, which we will call <em>abstract objects</em>. Methods of the
        Property interface are operations which may be performed on these abstract
        objects, such as projection over a dimension, convex hull, refinement with a
        linear constraint, etc... F-Bounded polymorphism is used for correctly typing
        the parameters and return value of these methods.
        A {@link it.unich.jppl.Domain} is a factory for abstract objects. Each class implementing
        {@link it.unich.jppl.Property} has a companion class implementing
        {@link it.unich.jppl.Domain} (for example, {@link it.unich.jppl.CPolyhedron}
        implements {@link it.unich.jppl.Property} while
        {@link it.unich.jppl.CPolyhedronDomain} implements
        {@link it.unich.jppl.Domain}).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the PPL is not thread safe, therefore the same holds for JPPL.
